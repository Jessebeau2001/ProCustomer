      What has happened here?

      Is that blood?'
    - 'Specter:

      Hey! What happened here, and why... why can''t I remember
      you?

      Hello? Who are you? What''s going on?'

      happened. I-I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t remember anything."

      Specter:

      What!
      I am right here... See I am with you on the picture.'
    - "Specter:\r\nAlly. I remember you.\u201D But\u2026 What?... Why can\u2019t
      I touch the picture? And YOU don't see me? *pause* I\u2019m not really here,
      am I?"
    - "Ally:\r How could you be so selfish?\r\nSpecter:\r Wait, no\u2026 that\u2019s
      not\u2026\r\nAlly:\r Did you not love me?"
    - "Specter:\nWait! A letter! I wrote you a letter. It\u2019s on the desk. But
      I\u2026 I ruined it. how do I make her read this? "
    - 'Specter:

      Here it is. I should throw the pen down the table to hopefully
      make Ally come here.'
    - 'Ally:

      You always were so damn messy.

      Wait, is that for me?'
    - "Ally:\r\nSo, you wrote me a letter? But, where\u2019s the rest, this is just
      a piece."
    - "Specter:\r\nThe rest? I think I know! That piece made me remember something.
      There has to be a connection, dark and night sky\u2026"
    - 'Ally:

      Oh wow! Specter has always been fascinated by space. Wait is
      that another piece?'
    - 'Ally: Why couldn''t you just be happy? You had such a god life.

      Specter:
      It''s not that simple. The letter will explain everything. Come on I know where
      to go next.'
